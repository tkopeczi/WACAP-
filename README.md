# Wine Appearance & Consumer Alignment Project (WACAP)

This repository hosts the open research program **Wine Appearance & Consumer Alignment Project (WACAP)**.

---

## Overview

WACAP is an international open research initiative exploring how wine packaging and appearance — such as bottle shape, size, embedded glass motifs (like the Tokaji long-neck), closure types (cork vs screw cap), and label paper materials — influence consumer quality perceptions, price expectations, and purchasing decisions.

The goal is to build empirical evidence and AI-based consumer perceptual profiles that support wineries in making data-driven packaging and positioning decisions, ultimately fostering sustainable and culturally rooted wine consumption.

## Current research streams (Autumn 2025 student projects)

1. **Bottle shape & size perception**  
   Focusing on regional bottles such as the Tokaji long-neck or engraved glass motifs and how they signal quality.

2. **Closure type study**  
   Based on the Austrian results of König et al. (2022, IJWBR), replicated in Hungary with Tokaj wines.

3. **Label paper material study**  
   Assessing how tactile and visual properties of label papers influence perceived quality and price expectations.

## Long-term perspective

Future directions include extended packaging studies (PET, cans, sustainability labels), building AI consumer avatars from perceptual data, and producing joint publications and conference presentations across institutions.
